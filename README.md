# Australia Postcodes Game

This web game lets you guess the postcode for a location in Australia. It now loads the location images using the Google Street View API rather than static placeholder pictures.

## Setup

1. Obtain a Google Maps API key with Street View imagery access.
2. Open `postcode_guess_game.html` and set the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` constant to your key.
3. Serve the HTML file with any web server and play the game in a browser.

The existing logo images remain in the `images` folder.
